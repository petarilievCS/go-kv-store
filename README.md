### KVStore: Lightweight In-Memory Key-Value Store in Go

A simple TCP-based key-value store written in Go, supporting basic commands like SET, GET, SETEX (with TTL), and STATS.

### Features
```
	•	SET <key> <value> – Store a key-value pair
	•	GET <key> – Retrieve the value for a key
	•	SETEX <key> <value> <ttl_seconds> – Set key with automatic expiration
	•	STATS – Returns basic metrics (command counts, active clients, errors)
	•	Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
	•	Handles multiple clients concurrently
	•	Includes a stress test script to simulate load
```

### How to Run

**Start the Server**

`go run ./server`

**Start the Client**

`go run ./client`

**Try Commands**

```
kv> SET foo bar
OK
```

```
kv> GET foo
bar
```

```
kv> SETEX temp value 5
OK
```

```
kv> STATS
Active clients: 1
SET: 1
GET: 1
SETEX: 1
Errors: 0
```

**Run Stress Test**

`go run ./stress`

**Command Summary**

Command	Description
```
SET key value	Stores the value
GET key	Retrieves the value
SETEX k v ttl	Stores value with expiration in seconds
STATS	Shows internal server metrics
```

**Graceful Shutdown**
	•	Pressing Ctrl+C triggers a clean shutdown:
	•	Stops accepting new connections
	•	Closes existing listener
	•	Logs shutdown status

**Future Ideas**
	•	Add persistence (write to file or database)
	•	Support DEL, EXISTS, or KEYS commands
	•	Authentication support
